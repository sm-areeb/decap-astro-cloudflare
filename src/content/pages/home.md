## Craft inspired by the coast

Our kitchen celebrates the seasons, partnering with sustainable fisheries, biodynamic farms, and small-batch artisans across the coastline. Every plate is a story of salt, smoke, and soil.

### Immersive dining

- Chef's counter experiences with fire-kissed courses
- Cellar pairings curated by our sommelier-in-residence
- Live jazz in the atrium every Thursday night

### Private gatherings

Host an unforgettable celebration in our glasshouse terrace or book the chef's library for an intimate tasting journey tailored to your guests.
