## The philosophy

Chef Lena grew up along rugged shorelines, learning to honor the catch of the day and celebrate the farmers who co-authored every meal. Coast & Ember continues that tradition with a menu that shifts with the tide.

## The team

Our front of house artisans, sommeliers, and pastry visionaries work in harmony to deliver evenings that feel both relaxed and remarkable.

## Sustainability

We collaborate with local kelp farms, regenerative ranches, and zero-waste distilleries to minimize our footprint without compromising on flavor.
