## Menu philosophy

Each tasting menu is designed to be enjoyed as a narrative, evolving from delicate raw preparations to deep, smoky expressions of the season. Because we work with small fisheries and farms, selections change frequently.

### Dietary accommodations

We are happy to tailor pescatarian, vegetarian, and gluten-free variations with 48 hours notice. Please note any allergies when you reserve.
